== Description ==
Create and customise a simple events (and past events) list. Display them on your page with a shortcode. The shortcodes can be customised to show only the things you need. All the elements have classes so styling is made easy.
In the WP admin it has the look and feel of Wordpress.


== Installation ==
1. Upload the unpacked folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.

= How simple is it? =
Maybe a bit overly simple!

No. Just a list and a single page.

Yes, if you like to.

== Screenshots ==
1. Create an event like any other post type. Just add a date, time, venue and location.
2. When published the event is visible and extra details are put above the the_content();.
3. There is also some help with the shortcodes if needed.
4. A list of your events in the WP-admin
5. The output of the shortcode, this is the list. Simple!
